## Introduction:
Edge populations of plants may be able to expand species’ ranges if they are able to adapt to changing conditions. Low-, mid-, and high-range populations of Rhinanthus minor were transplanted outside and within their original ranges to test relative plant fitness, measured by seed emergence, proportion of plants to graduate to a higher-level life stage, and flowering dates. This study was carried out on two peaks, the Nakiska (NK) and Hailstone butte (HB) peaks, to investigate whether climate changes could modify plant communities' ability of local adaptation for range expansion.

## Hypothesis with predicted figures:
This project aims to investigate the following questions:


**1.** Do sites sampled at different elevation from NK and HB vary in climate?

**2.** Do transplanted plants vary in their lifetime reproductive success between site and treatment?

**3.** Do plants transplanted to warmer ranged seed earlier than plants in cooler ranges, and does this change between NK and HB?

## Workflow:

All raw datasets are located in './Project/Data';

predicted figures are saved in 'Image';

R project is saved in 'Project';

output plots used for presentation are saved in './Project/Figure';

the main code chuncks are embedded in the 'FinalReport.rmd' file while 'ltrsPlots.rmd' includes codes for supplementary figures.
