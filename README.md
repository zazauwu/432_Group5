## Introduction:
Edge populations of plants may be able to expand species’ ranges if they are able to adapt to changing conditions. Low-, mid-, and high-range populations of Rhinanthus minor were transplanted outside and within their original ranges to test relative plant fitness, measured by seed emergence, proportion of plants to graduate to a higher-level life stage, and flowering dates. This study was carried out on two peaks, the Nakiska (NK) and Hailstone butte (HB) peaks, to investigate whether climate changes could modify plant communities' ability of local adaptation for range expansion.
